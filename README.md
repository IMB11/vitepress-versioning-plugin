# No longer being developed!

Unfortunately, I do not have the time to continue developing this plugin, it was originally just a "proof of concept" and I didn't really expect it to become the main way to create versioned doc sites using vitepress.

You should consider following the development of an eventually more stable plugin, such as https://github.com/its-miroma/vpv - thank you!
